## Introduction

**InfiniteVL** is a novel linear-complexity Vision-Language Model (VLM) architecture designed to overcome the computational bottlenecks of traditional Transformers in processing **unlimited multimodal streams**.


By synergizing **Sliding Window Attention (SWA)** for fine-grained local perception and **Gated DeltaNet** for efficient long-term memory, InfiniteVL achieves a "best of both worlds" balance. It delivers competitive performance on standard benchmarks (comparable to Qwen2.5-VL) while enabling constant-memory inference and high-throughput streaming.

## Architecture

<div align="center">
  <!-- 请确保将论文中的 Figure 2 截图保存为 assets/architecture.png -->
  <img src="assets/architecture.png" alt="InfiniteVL Architecture" width="50%">
</div>
<br>

**InfiniteVL** adopts a hybrid architecture that synergizes the efficiency of linear attention with the precision of window-based attention. The model comprises a **Vision Encoder** (adapted from Qwen2.5-VL), a **Projection MLP**, and a **Decoder-only LLM Backbone**.

### Key Design Highlights

*   **Hybrid Block Design**: The LLM backbone consists of **9 Hybrid Blocks**. Within each block, we strategically interleave:
    *   **1 Sliding Window Attention (SWA) Layer**: Responsible for capturing high-resolution local context and fine-grained visual details.
    *   **3 Gated DeltaNet Layers**: Responsible for modeling long-range global dependencies with linear complexity.

*   **Constant Memory Footprint**: Unlike traditional Transformers where the Key-Value (KV) cache grows linearly with sequence length ($O(N)$), the **Gated DeltaNet** layers compress history into a fixed-size memory state (e.g., $16 \times 128 \times 256$). This enables **constant memory usage** and constant inference latency, even when processing unlimited input streams.

*   **Seamless Integration**: By combining SWA and Gated DeltaNet, InfiniteVL achieves the "best of both worlds":
    *   Local attention ensures high performance on information-intensive tasks (e.g., OCR, Document Understanding).
    *   Linear attention ensures efficiency and stability for long-context scenarios (e.g., Streaming Video Understanding).

## Training Strategy

To achieve strong multimodal performance with minimal training resources, InfiniteVL employs a **three-stage progressive training strategy**. This approach allows our linear-complexity model to inherit the vast knowledge of a Transformer teacher before adapting to long-context scenarios.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/training_strategy.png" alt="Training Pipeline" width="90%">
</div>

### Stage 1: Distillation Pretraining (Efficient Initialization)
*   **Goal:** Rapidly transfer knowledge from the **Qwen2.5-VL** teacher to the InfiniteVL student.
*   **Method:** We replace the teacher's attention layers with **Gated DeltaNet** while keeping other parameters frozen. We use **Layer-wise MSE Loss** (to align internal states) and **End-to-End KL Divergence** (to align output logits).
*   **Significance:** This bypasses the difficulty of training linear attention from scratch, ensuring a robust initialization.

### Stage 2: Instruction SFT (General Capabilities)
*   **Goal:** Unlock strong instruction-following and reasoning capabilities.
*   **Data:** **~8M** diverse multimodal instruction pairs, covering General VQA, OCR, Mathematics, and Code.
*   **Settings:** Image resolution increased to **1344×1344**; max context length set to 8,192.
*   **Outcome:** Produces the **Stage 2 Model**, which offers the best performance on standard benchmarks.

### Stage 3: Long-Sequence SFT (Context Extension)
*   **Goal:** Activate the architecture's potential for **unlimited-length processing** and streaming.
*   **Data:** A mixture of Stage 2 data (800K) and **~200K long-sequence samples** (e.g., long videos, multi-page documents).
*   **Method:** **LoRA** fine-tuning with context length extended to **32,768**.
*   **Outcome:** Produces the **Stage 3 Model**, enabling length extrapolation and stable streaming inference.

## Model Zoo

We release two versions of InfiniteVL-4B to cater to different application scenarios.

| Model | Stage | Description | Training context Length | Download |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **InfiniteVL-4B** | **Stage 2** | **Best Generalist / Base.** The checkpoint directly after Instruction SFT. It delivers the **peak foundational performance** on standard multimodal benchmarks (e.g., OCR, MMMU, MathVista) and preserves the most robust knowledge. | 8K | [🤗 Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/hustvl/InfiniteVL) |
| **InfiniteVL-4B-LongSFT** | **Stage 3** | **Long-Context Adapted.** Fine-tuned using only a **small amount** of long-sequence multimodal data. It successfully activates length generalization for streaming scenarios, though its full potential on extreme contexts is not yet fully exploited. | 32K | [🤗 Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/hustvl/InfiniteVL-LongSFT) |


> **💡 Recommendations:**
>
> *   **For Long-Context Inference:** Please use the **Stage 3** model. It enables stable streaming inference and avoids memory explosion.
> *   **For Training / Fine-tuning:** We strongly recommend using the **Stage 2** model as your starting point. Since it maintains the strongest general capabilities and hasn't shifted towards the specific long-context distribution, it serves as the best foundation for adaptation to new tasks or domains.

## 🚀 Advanced Usage: CUDA Graph Acceleration

Unlike Transformer-based VLMs where the KV cache grows dynamically, **InfiniteVL maintains a constant-size memory state**. This unique property allows us to use **CUDA Graphs** to capture the entire computation graph for both streaming prefill and decoding, eliminating kernel launch overheads and maximizing GPU utilization.

This is the key technology behind our **24 FPS** real-time streaming performance.

### ⚡ Accelerated Streaming Inference

Unlike Transformer-based VLMs where the KV cache grows dynamically, **InfiniteVL maintains a constant-size memory state**. This unique property allows us to use **CUDA Graphs** to capture the entire computation graph for streaming prefill, eliminating kernel launch overheads.

We provide a complete script in [`examples/demo_streaming_inference.py`](examples/demo_streaming_inference.py) to demonstrate this capability.

> **🎥 Simulation Note:** This script **simulates a real-time streaming scenario** by reading a local video file frame-by-frame. It treats the video as a continuous data stream, updating the global linear memory state on-the-fly without retraining.
>
> **⚠️ Requirement:** This demo relies on the specialized model implementation (supporting `StaticCachePrealloc` and CUDA Graphs) located in the **[`infinitevl/infinitevl_streaming`](infinitevl/infinitevl_streaming)** directory. Please ensure your environment is set up correctly to import these modules.

#### 1. Run the Simulation Demo
```bash
# Make sure you are in the project root
python examples/demo_streaming_inference.py \
    --model_path /path/to/InfiniteVL-4B \
    --video_path assets/demo.mp4 \
    --fps 30
```

### ⚡ Accelerated Decode

In addition to streaming prefill, InfiniteVL natively supports **CUDA Graph-accelerated decoding**. By capturing the decoding step into a static graph, we can achieve extremely low-latency token generation, further enhancing the responsiveness of real-time interactions.

> 🚧 **Coming Soon:** The code for accelerated decoding is currently being refactored and cleaned up. We are working hard to release it as soon as possible. Please stay tuned!


## Qualitative Analysis & Visualization

We provide visualization cases to demonstrate InfiniteVL's robust performance across diverse scenarios, ranging from information-intensive static tasks to ultra-long streaming video understanding.

### 1. Fundamental Visual-Language Capabilities (OCR & Reasoning)
InfiniteVL effectively overcomes the traditional limitations of linear attention in detailed visual perception. By combining Sliding Window Attention with Gated DeltaNet, it excels at **Dense Text Recognition (OCR), Chart Interpretation, and Complex Scene Description**, delivering performance comparable to full-attention Transformers.

### 2. Long-Term Streaming Understanding
The core strength of InfiniteVL lies in its ability to maintain coherent memory over **unlimited input streams**.

The examples below demonstrate a continuous street-view video stream. InfiniteVL maintains a constant memory state and accurately answers questions at various timestamps (e.g., Frame 3100, ~1M tokens processed), recalling specific details like "NBC Studios" text or the color of a pedestrian's bag without forgetting.
